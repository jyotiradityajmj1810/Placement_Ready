Placement Ready
Project Overview
Problem Statement
Students often struggle to prepare for placements when companies arrive on campus. Despite the abundance of resources available, there is a lack of guidance at the last moment, leading to difficulties in making the right decisions and effectively utilizing their time.

Proposed Solution:

Our app, Placement Ready, aims to address this issue by providing mentorship and resources to students whenever they are ready to study for placements.

Mentorship: We facilitate mentorship by having college faculties and industry experts available on the platform. Students can seek guidance through chat and schedule in-person meetings when necessary.

Resources: We offer a comprehensive set of resources, including Data Structures and Algorithms (DS-ALGO) questions to help students grasp the syntax. Additionally, we provide interview-specific questions tailored to different rounds of placements.
